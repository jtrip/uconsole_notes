# uConsole Notes
Notes about working with the uConsole from clockwork pi.


## MISC

### scrot
Scrot is preinstalled and configured to run on key press `print` (`Fn + Select`).
The definition of the keyboard shortcut if lxde specific.

system config is in:  
`/etc/xdg/openbox/lxde-pi-rc.xml`

So far most suggestions are to copy that to `~/.config/openbox/lxde-pi-rc.xml` and make changes there but that has not been successful so far.
